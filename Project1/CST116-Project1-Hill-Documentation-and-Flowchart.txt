The errors included in my code were a missing "{" in a for statement (syntax),
and an input being written to the wrong variable. (logic)

// Meetings

On week 3 I exchanged contact information with Jonathan in class. This happened on 10/5

On week 4 me and Jonathan met at 10pm on 10/16 to exchange code and discuss any challenges there may have been with the project. We chatted over Discord.

// Status Updates //

week 3
In this session, I will set up the inputs and outputs for part 1
I know how to take inputs, store them in variables, and send them out as messages. I also know how to use classes to store multiple variables, how to access those variables, and how to add functions to a class.
I don't know how to use strings in C++, so I'll look into that during this session.

week 4
In this session I'll update my program to display floats to 2 points after the decimal, and to use for() loops to ask for the user's input more efficiently.
I know how to use arrays, so I'll also use that to move and access data more efficiently.
I don't know how to display floats in non-scientific notation or how to display the appropriate precision.

week 5
In this session I'll finish part 2, and apply formatting to this program with <iomanip>
I know for my variables I need to use strings for names, floats for GPA, doubles for income, and integers for age.
I've never used do{} or switch statements before, so I'll learn how to use them for this task. I also have never used <iomanip>
